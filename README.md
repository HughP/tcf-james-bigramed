# Mephaa keyboard analysis

**Language**: [tcf]

**Text source**: Mark Weathers

**Text content**: Epistle of James

**Keyboard layout history**: The Spanish Windows ANSI keyboard layout was co-opted with redundant Spanish characters replaced by Maphaa characters. This was done in conjunction with replacing the glyphs in a special font, so that no keyboard setting needed to be changed on the computer. Simply type as normal on a Spanish keyboard and use the Mephaa file.

**Text processing steps**:

1. Text received, as `JAS_TCF.txt`
2. Moved characters from hacked font code points to proper Unicode values, using [`Teckit`](https://github.com/silnrsi/teckit). `me'phaa.map` & `me'phaa.tec`
3. Replaced all characters in the Mephaa text with their corresponding values as if they were English characters typed on a QWERTY keyboard. (Done by hand via search and replace.) resulting file: `tcf-on-QWERTY.txt`
<<<<<<< HEAD
 This allows for [`Typing`](https://github.com/michaeldickens/Typing) to process the characters (really in the mental model of typing it is processing keypresses not characters). [`Typing`](https://github.com/michaeldickens/Typing) only processes characters as if they are single byte, so no two or three byte characters work with the program.
5. `tcf-on-QWERTY-UCC.txt` is a quick check to show that all characters in the file are in the single byte range.
6. [`Typing`](https://github.com/michaeldickens/Typing) requires a list of character bigrams and a list of character counts.
 The default method is to use an application by Michael Dickens called [`Frequency`](https://github.com/michaeldickens/Frequency). - Hugh has had some difficulty in getting that to compile. So in lieu of using that Hugh started down the path of step _Seven_.
  [`Typing`](https://github.com/michaeldickens/Typing) assumes that there is a one to one correspondence between each single byte character and each keystroke. Processes in step three ensure that all all multi-byte characters are converted to single byte characters and their corresponding positions. This can allow [`Typing`](https://github.com/michaeldickens/Typing) to give us a fitness value (by running the tests against the existing QWERTY setting), it can also allow [`Typing`](https://github.com/michaeldickens/Typing) to make a projection about how to organize a keyboard layout based on [`Typing`](https://github.com/michaeldickens/Typing)'s simulated annealing algorithm.
7. To create bigrams and character count the following scripts were used:

[`Typing`](https://github.com/michaeldickens/Typing) only processes characters as if they are single byte, so no two or three byte characters work with the program. However this means that if a language corpus is convertedd from their orthographical representation it can be re-rendered as a keypress representation. This keypress representation can just so happen to have QWERTY codepoints - the result is not English, rather some language as goblety gook. Another way to think about this would be to use ISO 9995 names of keys.

6. To create bigrams and character count the following scripts were used:
>>>>>>> 0fe6f83b0fcf687faa0953f2b85834845d422d42

  ```
./bigrams.py tcf-on-QWERTY.txt > allDigrams.txt
 ```
 Then to get the character counts.
  ```
 UnicodeCCount.pl -n tcf-on-QWERTY.txt | cut  -f 2,3 | tr "\t" " " > all
 Characters.txt && sed -i '1d' allCharacters.txt
 ```

 Then the character for new line had to be added to the top line as `\n`.

<!-- 7. To create bigrams the service at the following website was used: https://www.dcode.fr/bigrams. The following settings were also used:
   *  ALL CHARACTERS (INCLUDING PUNCTUATION AND SYMBOLS)
   * STANDARDIZATION OF LETTERS (IGNORE UPPER-LOWER CASE AND DIACRITICS) [un-checked]
   * Analyze BY SLIDING (ABCDEF => AB,BC,CD,DE,EF)
   * KEEP WORDS BORDERS (ABC_DE â‰  ABCDE) [checked]
   * COUNT APPEARANCES

  The website produces a down-loadable `.csv` file `tcf-on-QWERTY-bigram-count-ori.csv`. Some editing of this CSV file is necessary to convert it into the same format of bigram file that [`Typing`](https://github.com/michaeldickens/Typing) expects (`\n` for new line, `\\` for `\`, `\t` for TAB, and only a space between the character column and the count column). -->
